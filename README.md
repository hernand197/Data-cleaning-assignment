## Data-cleaning-assignment

Using the stockmarket.csv file I was able to explore the raw data inside the file as well as create a file that cleans the data and saved it as cleaned.parquet. In this process I also created 3 parquet files:
* Daily avg close by ticker
* Avg volume by sector 
* Simple daily return by ticker
* 
We then were instructed to used Streamlit to load the parquet files, add filters and visualize charts.
